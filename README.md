# Tic Tac Toe: The Multiplayer Version
A quick project to practice creating a multiplayer typescript tictactoe game. It is NOT in good shape.
- There is a LOT of code redundancy AND some unused code.
- Interacting with the board feels like crap.
- There is no secure authentication going on
- I think I'll stop here

Feel free to use this however you want.
